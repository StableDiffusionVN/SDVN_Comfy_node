### BaseNode
*A collection of smart nodes that replace basic tasks, helping users build processes smarter and faster*

![Base Nodes](/preview/base_node.png)

**📀 Load checkpoint / 🎨 Load Lora**

 Supports 2 methods of loading checkpoint and downloading checkpoint directly for use.
 - If you leave the Download_url information, checkpoint will be selected according to the Ckpt_name
 - If you enter the checkpoint download url and leave the Download - True option, the checkpoint will be downloaded to checkpoints/loras folder and named Ckpt_url_name

Additionally, these two nodes support a curated list of commonly used checkpoints and LoRAs. If the models are not already available in the folder, they will be automatically downloaded.

**🏞️ Load Image / 🏞️ Load Image Url**

- Support 2 images download methods from input folders and URL links / Image Path
- Support sub-folders in the input folder

**🏞️ Load Image Folder**

- Load a list with number images from a folder.
- If random = True, the images will be completely random; otherwise, they will be a sequence of images that are adjacent to each other.
- If `number < 1`, the entire folder of images will be loaded.

**🏞️ Load Pinterest**

Automatically search and download images from Pinterest. Images will be automatically downloaded to the input folder, organized into separate subfolders.

- Url:
  -	Accepts any Pinterest image link (single image, board, board section, or profile page) (e.g., https://www.pinterest.com/...). If the link starts with a slash /, the prefix https://www.pinterest.com will be automatically added (e.g., /abc/vintage ⇨ https://www.pinterest.com/abc/vintage).
  
  - Accepts any keyword and will automatically search for images on Pinterest using that keyword.
- Range: Location – Number of images that will be downloaded to the input folder.
- Number: The number of images that will be loaded and returned. If random = True, the images will be randomly selected from the downloaded list; otherwise, the images will be selected based on their position determined by the seed.

**🏞️ Load Image Ultimate**

This is a powerful node that combines 5 different loading modes (Input Folder, Custom Folder, Pinterest, Insta, URL) to enhance flexibility in workflows. The options will automatically adjust based on the selected mode, and the usage is similar to the corresponding image loading nodes above.

**🔡 CLIP Text Encode**

- Simultaneously support both Positive, Negative
- Support Random ability with Dynamic Prompt (Request installed node [Dynamicprompts](https://github.com/adieyal/comfyui-dynamicprompts))
- Support Translate function
- Support Style Card.

**🗂️ Prompt Styles**

- Supports easier prompt writing with pre-saved and curated style presets.
- You can add or edit style cards by renaming and modifying the file my_styles.csv.example to my_styles.csv.

**🎚️ Controlnet Apply**

Provide full option to use ControlNet in a single node (Request installed node [Controlnet Aux](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux))
- Can choose Controlnet Model, Preprocessor (Automatically detect Aux Preprocessor Aux Preprocessor + Add Invert Image option), Union Type
- Show preview pictures Preprocessor when running
- Supports automatic downloading of most popular ControlNet models for SD15, SDXL, and Flux.
- Supports direct usage with ControlNet Inpaint Alimama Flux.
- Supports exporting parameters for integration with the AutoGenerate node.

**🌈 Apply Style Model**

-	Supports automatic downloading of style and CLIP models
-	Supports working with masks, downsampling, and various crop modes (Note: these features may not work well with Redux 512). (See more in Redux Adv: https://github.com/kaibioinfo/ComfyUI_AdvancedRefluxControl)

**⏳ Ksampler**

Smart node with many quick options to support flexibly in many different cases, help minimize errors and more flexibility to use.
- Convert 2 options for **negative** and **latent** to optional.
  - Without Negative, an empty clip will be replaced, now the way to connect to Flux will be in accordance with its nature - is not to use Negative
  - Without Latent, an empty Latent image will be created according to the size of Tile Width and Tile Height
- **ModelType:** Automatically adjust **CFG, Sampler name, Scheduler** for different types of models (SD15, SDXL, SDXL lightning, SDXL hyper, Flux ...). Now it is not a headache when it is too much.
- **StepsType:** Automatically adjust Steps according to the model and by Denoise ( Steps = Standing Steps x Denoise). Helps optimize the accurate and fastest process
- **Tiled:** Automatically divide the tiled block by mixture of differenters to minimize GPU when running Ksampler, applied in case of large image size and baby denoise (Request installed node [TiledDiffusion](https://github.com/shiimizu/ComfyUI-TiledDiffusion)). In case there is no latent, size tile = tile_width/2, tile_height/2
- Support FluxGuidance

**👨‍🎨 Inpaint**

A comprehensive Inpaint support, consolidated from 4 Node Vae Encode, Latent Noise Mask, Vae Encode (For Inpainting), InpaintModelCondinging
- Vae Encode: If Mask = None
- Vae Encode (For Inpainting): If Postive or Negative = None
- Latent Noise Mask: If SetLatentNoiseMask = True
- InpaintModelCondinging: If SetLatentNoiseMask = False, all Image, Vae, Postive, Negative

# Preset

Nodes that help simplify the process of building workflows. Nodes designed around the `💡 Auto Generate` node to streamline workflows.

![](preview/preset_node.png)

**📋 Quick Menu**

- Output selected checkpoints, LoRAs and strings in one node.

**💿 Load Model**

- Load a checkpoint together with up to five LoRAs from saved libraries.

**💡 Auto Generate**

- The node will automatically generate images and calculate parameters to ensure the generation is as fast and accurate as possible.
- Automatically selects KSampler, Scheduler, and CFG based on the input model (SD15, SDXL, Flux). For SDXL, if steps = 8, parameters will be adjusted according to SDXL Lightning. Users can manually choose KSampler, Scheduler, and CFG via the AdvSetting option.
- Automatically splits image segments and creates an upscale–hires fix workflow based on the model and image generation size. Users can manually select the upscale model via the AdvSetting option.
- Automatically detects the language and translates the Prompt / Negative Prompt into English.
- The prompt and negative prompt sections support dynamic prompts. (When Random_prompt = True and used with a list, the returned results will vary each time).
- Automatically switches to an img2img or inpaint process when an input image or mask is provided. If the input model is an inpaint/fill model, set inpaint_model = True to automatically apply optimal parameters. Image size will automatically adjust to maintain the aspect ratio of the input image.
- Add ControlNet and ApplyStyle settings via parameters using the `🎚️ Controlnet Apply` and `🌈 Apply Style Model` nodes. Multiple parameters can be added at once by using the `🔄 Join Parameter` node.
- Steps will be automatically recalculated based on the denoise value, using the formula: `Step = Steps × Denoise`.
